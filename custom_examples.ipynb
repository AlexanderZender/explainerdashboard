    "- define your callbacks in `._register_callbacks(self, app)`. This way the ExplainerComponent automatically register all calbacks of register components first, and then call `_register_callbacks(app)`. Alternatively you just have to make sure that you register all callbacks of subcomponents in the `register_callbacks(app)` method. \n",
