explainer_plots
*****************

This module contains functions that output plotly figs. They can be used 
independently, although they usually expect data to be formatted in a particular
way. The ``Explainer`` preformats the data in the right way using ``explainer_methods.py``
and then feeds them to these functions.

*(Under construction: still need to add sphinx compatible docstrings to the functions)*
