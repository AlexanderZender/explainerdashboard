Using the ExplainerComponent primitives it becomes easy to glue together
different components into a layout. A nunber of standard combinations of 
components have been defined as Composites.

These als serve as the backbone for the various ExplainerTabs.

ExplainerTabs
=============

These are the standard tabs that you see when you build an ``ExplainerDashboard``.

Now they are mostly just a wrapper for the equivalent ExplainerComposites, but
kept around for naming clarity and backward compatibility.
